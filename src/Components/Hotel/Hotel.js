                        The cottage was the cutest one. However there was no electricity, we relied on solar power to recharge mobile. There was table fan in the room. but the weather was cool as it was raining. I loved the food they gave. It was Vetki Fish, Shrimp fry and fresh vegetables. I loved the traditional breakfast with ruti and vegetables. In the evening they gave us some seasonal fruits which were also very good.                    </p>
